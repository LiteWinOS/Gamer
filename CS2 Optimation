Memory Context Restore (MCR) / Power Down Enable: On AMD platforms (especially AM5), disabling "Memory Context Restore" or "Power Down Enable" 
in some cases has shown to reduce input lag and improve frame times, though it will increase boot times. Experiment with this.

Disable C-States (C1E, C3, C6, C7): This is one of the most consistently recommended changes for reducing input lag. 
Prevents the CPU from entering low-power states, ensuring it's always ready for immediate action.

Disable EIST (Intel SpeedStep) / Cool'n'Quiet (AMD): Similar to C-states, 
these dynamic frequency adjustments can introduce micro-stutters.

Disable Unused Onboard Devices: If you use a discrete GPU, disable onboard graphics. If you use a dedicated sound card, disable onboard audio. 
If you have a separate network card, disable onboard LAN. This frees up system resources and reduces potential DPC latency sources.
