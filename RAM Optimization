Ram Optimization


XMP is Overclock Profile 
which mean, it not fully tested by the OEM*
so if u enable it on ur system ure getting not just good memory boost and latency 
but also u might get some inconsistency

so we need to sometimes look for better voltages to keep it up in stress cases like cs2

So like DDR4 which gonna have 1.2v in non-xmp profile 
and 1.35v in XMP, u might have sometimes need to increase it to 1.4v
cos the memory bin is not perfect, their[OEM*] testing cant products that kind of benchmark


So DDR Voltage from 1.35v to 1.4v
VCCSA - 1.2v from default
Disable Block Feq OC - so it will do 100.000 Mhz without changing [ SO also not 'Auto' setting either ]

U might need to also change 
VCCIO look it up
