To sum up our conversation, here is a "Cheat Sheet" for using the MSI Mode Utility effectively without breaking your system.
Core Concepts

    MSI / MSI-X (The "Modern" Way): Devices send "data messages" directly to the CPU. It is faster, handles more tasks at once, and reduces CPU lag.

    Line-Based (The "Old" Way): Devices use physical electrical lines to signal the CPU. This is slower and can cause "traffic jams" (conflicts) if multiple devices share one line.

    IRQ Numbers: If the number is positive, you are in Line-based mode. If it is negative (e.g., -5), you have successfully enabled MSI mode.

Priority & Limits

    Priority: Sets the "importance" of a device's request.

        High: Use for your GPU (for FPS) and maybe Networking (for ping).

        Undefined/Normal: Use for everything else. Setting everything to "High" defeats the purpose.

    Max Limit: Leave this as the default. It defines how many "messages" a device can send at once; changing it manually often causes system crashes.

### The "Do & Don't" Guide

| Device Type | Action | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Graphics Card (GPU)** | **ENABLE (High)** | Improves frame pacing and reduces micro-stutters. (Must redo after every driver update!) |
| **Network Adapter** | **ENABLE (Normal/High)** | Can stabilize ping and reduce "lag spikes." |
| **Audio Controller** | **ENABLE (Normal)** | Often fixes audio crackling or popping sounds. |
| **USB Controllers** | **CAUTION** | Only enable for the controller your **mouse** is on. Setting others can crash webcams or headsets. |
| **SATA/Storage** | **CAUTION** | Can improve disk speed, but if unsupported, Windows might fail to boot. |
| **Bridge/Chipset** | **DO NOT TOUCH** | Critical system "plumbing." Changing these usually leads to a Blue Screen (BSOD). |

Final Recommendations

    Check for support: Only check the box if the "MSI" column in the utility says "Yes" or shows it is supported.

    Safety First: Create a System Restore Point before making changes.

    The "Mouse" Test: If you enable it on a USB controller and your mouse stops moving, plug it into a different port (front vs. back) to get back into the app and revert the setting.
